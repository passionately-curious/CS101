# CS101 - C++ Codes

This repository is used to store C++ codes written for the CS101-Computer Programming and Utilization course. I make weekly commits with a folder structure like `week1`, `week2`, etc. to add new files and assignments of the course.  I also use this repo to learn and practice Git branching.

## Folder Structure

- `week1/`: Contains C++ codes and exercises for the first week.
- `week2/`: Contains C++ codes and exercises for the second week.
- And so on...

## Running the Codes

Some of the codes require Simple C++ (simplecpp) to run. You can install it by following the instructions provided [here](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ranade/simplecpp/).

To run a C++ file, use the following commands:

```bash
s++ filename.cpp
./a.out
```

## Usage

### Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository, use the following command:

```bash
